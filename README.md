I worked with a team of engineers to build a front-end online retail web application. This repo is specifically for the Related Items section of the web application.

# Application Details
## Related Items
A dynamic photo carousel where each product card also renders a thumbnail photo carousel to allow the user to view additional photos. The user can select the star icon to compare the current product item to the related item selected. 
## Your Outfit
A dynamic photo carousel where the user can add the current product item to their list or delete the item via the 'x' icon.
